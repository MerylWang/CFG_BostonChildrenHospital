Families can explore every corner of this fully-equipped Japanese house reconstructed in Boston by Japanese carpenters. Japanese family life, customs, ceremonies, art, architecture and seasonal events are all highlighted in the fully functional 100-year-old house inside the Museum. This House was a gift to the City of Boston from the City of Kyoto on the 20th Anniversary of their sister city relationship in 1979.  It was brought to the United States piece by piece and rebuilt at Boston Children’s Museum, where it still stands today. Very few of these houses still exist even in Japan, so come explore this rare and very special landmark."></button>"
